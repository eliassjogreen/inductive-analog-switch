# Inductive Analog Switches

This library contains footprints and symbols for inductive analog keyboard
switches for use with the Texas Instruments LDC1312, LDC1314, LDC1312 and
LDC1314 inductance to digital converters.

Supported footprints for switches are currently PCB or plate mounted, LED or no
